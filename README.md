# Random Jeopardy Clues

This is a website that displays a randomly selected Jeopardy clue and answer from the Jepp API. Jepp is an API that contains a database of over 175,000 clues that have been used on Jeopardy throughout the years. I have been a big fan of Jeopardy and trivia in general ever since watching Ken Jennings' original 74-game win streak in 2004.

## Future Enhancements:

<li>Create a text input box that lets the user guess the answer to the clue.</li>

<li>Implement a way to keep score of the user's count of correct/incorrect answers.</li>
<li>Add area to display dollar amounts of clues.</li>
</ul>

<br>

## Completed Enhancements:

<ul>
<li>Remove the need for a 'Reset' button by integrating the reset functionality into the 'Get Answer' button. In this project's current state, it will continue to display the answer to the previous clue if you do not press 'Reset' before retrieving the next clue.</li>
</ul>
